# Capstone-Project
In this project, my team developed credit score models with high-ranking power to reject the loan applicants with highest risks, and presented the findings to senior managers at the organization.

In the first part, we conducted EDA on a dataset with over 1800 variables, and selected features using Random Forest, Boruta and Univariate Analysis with Python.

Next, we trained models using advanced machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, XGBoost and H2O AutoML, and fine tuned the hyperparameters to optimize the performance of our models.
